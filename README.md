# Various Notebooks IN3050/4050 Spring 2021
by Marius Aasan (mariuaas(at)math⋅uio⋅no) - IN3050/4050 Group 3 - 1015-1200

These are worked examples for Group 3 in the course IN3050/4050, [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN3050/index-eng.html) for Spring 2021.

Remember that these are here to help you understand the basics, but you should ideally work on the weekly exercises yourself to get a grasp on the material. Therefore, these examples are rather minimal, and might omit certain crucial parts of code which can be used in the mandatory assignments!
